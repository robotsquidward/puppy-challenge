# Pup Patrol

![Workflow result](https://github.com/robotsquidward/puppy-challenge/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description

On the lookout for a new pup! Pup Patrol is a quick and easy way to browse available doggo's who can't wait to be adopted!

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

I was excited to use this dev challenge to jump back into Compose now that it hit Beta. I really enjoyed building a practice app using Compose in the alpha days and was excited to come back and see how the API has changed & stabilized.
